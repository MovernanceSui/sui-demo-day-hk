## Basic Information
Movernance is the first full-featured on-chain governance platform for the Sui ecosystem. It provides the necessary decentralized governance platform for projects by integrating governance forums and on-chain voting functions. And Movernance innovatively proposes an authority governance framework and a governance rights market (bribe platform), which improves the overall efficiency of decentralized governance and provides a solid foundation for the large-scale application of projects.

## Project Description 
Movernance is building the first full-featured on-chain governance platform for the Sui ecosystem. It integrates governance forums and on-chain voting to provide a decentralized governance platform for projects. Movernance also proposes an innovative authority governance framework and a governance rights market (bribe platform) to improve the efficiency of decentralized governance and provide a solid foundation for large-scale project applications. Movernance will also launch an off-chain governance framework for projects.         

Movernance's Key Feature:

1. Incentive mechanism: Movernance has a function that provides funding incentives for different governance proposals. This allows users to fund specific proposal options to motivate members with voting rights to vote as desired. Members can receive corresponding governance rewards, which enhances the current lack of direct economic incentives for on-chain governance. 

2. One-stop governance service from voting to payment: Movernance will integrate with OpenSui, a secured and open-source wallet on Sui to provide multi-sig wallet solutions for projects who have needs for sending funds after voting and making their vaults more transparent to the community. 

3. NFT-Based DAO Governance Toolbox: Movernance supports a complete NFT-based governance process, offering a full set of functions from NFT issuance to DAO governance and operation. 


Movernance’s Milestones: 

The first milestone we are going to reach recently is that we’ll launch 
Movernance on Sui Devnet as well as Sui Testnet and open it to the community in April. In this stage, we’ll keep upgrading our platform,  cooperate with other high-quality projects in Sui ecosystem, and build our community. 

The second milestone for us is to launch Movernance on Sui mainnet as soon as Sui mainnet is live. We’ll finish the security audit and integrate with the projects we’ve cooperated. Moreover, various community campaigns will be conducted to promote the arrival of Sui mass adoption. 

In the fourth quarter of this year, we’ll add the incentives system into our governance framework. And in March of 2024, we’ll provide multi-sig wallet solutions for projects who have needs for sending funds after voting and making their vaults more transparent to the community. 

Following the above, we aim to provide the most basic governance service platform for projects, while expanding our own innovation in the Sui field, and developing more enriched governance features to promote the decentralized governance in Sui ecosystem.
